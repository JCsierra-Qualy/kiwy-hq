# Kiwy HQ — MVP Plan

Goal: internal portal on port 3334 with simple token auth, a Secrets section (store AppSheet + n8n keys locally, never print), and a simple dashboard grouped by areas (Qualiver/ECHO/Kuenti/Personal) showing current status + links.

Non-goals (MVP): production-grade SSO, multi-user, full encryption at rest, deep integrations.
